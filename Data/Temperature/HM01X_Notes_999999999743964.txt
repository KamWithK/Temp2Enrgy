PARAMETER NOTES
---------------




PRECIPITATION

Precipitation since 9 am is the cumulative precipitation recorded since 9 am local time. The rainfall total is reset to zero daily at 9 am local time.

Precipitation is measured using a "Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge" (TBRG). Most TBRGs report rainfall to 0.2 mm, but some report to 0.1 or 0.5 mm.

Rainfall includes all forms of water particles, whether liquid (for example, rain or drizzle) or solid (hail or snow), that fall from clouds and 
reach the ground at the point of observation. Note that rainfall totals may be under-reported during snowy and/or windy conditions. 
For more information please refer to: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/how/observations/rain-measure.shtml




TEMPERATURE

Temperature measurements are recorded in a Stevenson Screen which allows for good air flow across the thermometers, and prevents heating from 
direct sunlight. The height of the thermometers is approximately 1.2 m above the ground. For more information please refer to: 
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/cdo/about/airtemp-measure.shtml

Most air temperature measurements made at an Automatic Weather Station are instantaneous values (1-second samples). A small proportion of our 
Automatic Weather Stations report a 1-minute average for air temperature. The difference, if any, between these reporting periods is insignificant.




WET-BULB TEMPERATURE

Wet-bulb temperature is usually calculated from temperature, dew point temperature (calculated from relative humidity) and pressure, or measured 
using a standard mercury-in-glass thermometer with the thermometer bulb wrapped in muslin which is kept wet. The evaporation of water from the 
thermometer has a cooling effect, so the temperature indicated by the wet bulb thermometer is less than the temperature indicated by a dry-bulb 
(normal, unmodified) thermometer.




DEW POINT TEMPERATURE

Dew point Temperature is the temperature to which the air must be cooled (at a constant pressure and water vapour content), in order for condensation 
of water vapour to occur. It therefore directly indicates the moisture content of the air; a low value indicates dry air. The closer the dew point is 
to the air temperature, the moister the air and the higher the relative humidity. Note that dew point temperature is a calculated value, derived from 
measurements of temperature and relative humidity.

Most dew point temperature measurements made at an Automatic Weather Station are instantaneous values (1-second samples). A small proportion of our 
Automatic Weather Stations report a 1-minute average for dew point temperature. The difference, if any, between these reporting periods is insignificant.




RELATIVE HUMIDITY

Relative humidity (RH) represents the moisture content of the air. It is the ratio of the amount of moisture actually in the air to the maximum amount of 
moisture which the air could hold at the same temperature. RH is obtained either from measurements by an electronic relative humidity sensor or derived 
via complex equations using air temperature and dew point temperature. There can be slight differences between RH values measured directly by a relative 
humidity sensor and those derived using equations. Typically these differences are less than 1%. 

Most Automatic Weather Stations report observations of RH as instantaneous values (1-second samples). A small proportion of Automatic Weather Stations 
report a 1-minute average RH. The difference, if any, between these reporting periods is insignificant.

The uncertainty associated with RH data increases at the extremes. That is, in very dry air as RH approaches 0%, and in very humid conditions as RH 
approaches 100%. There are some occasions when reported RH values may slightly exceed 100%. In these instances you should consider the value to be 100%.

The following formulas have been used:

Relative Humidity = Vapour pressure / Saturated vapour pressure * 100

Vapour pressure = exp (1.8096 + (17.269425 * Dew_Point)/(237.3 + Dew_Point))

Saturated Vapour pressure = exp (1.8096 + (17.269425 * Air_Temperature)/(237.3 + Air_Temperature))




WIND

Wind speed and direction are typically an average over the 10 minutes prior to the observation time. Measurements are made using an automatic anemometer, 
usually at a height of approximately 10 metres above the surface. When a significant wind change occurs during the 10 minute period prior to an observation, 
additional special observations may be reported by the AWS. In these cases, the wind data is not always averaged over the standard 10 minute averaging period.

Wind speed is usually measured by the anemometer in whole knots, but archived in SI units of m/s to 1 decimal point (0.1 m/s). 1m/s = 1.94kn = 3.6km/h approximately.

Wind gusts reported are the highest 3 second mean wind speed (sampled every second) over the last 10 minutes. When a significant wind change occurs during 
the 10 minute period prior to an observation, additional special observations may be reported by the AWS. In these cases, the wind gust data does not always 
apply to the standard 10 minute period.

Wind direction can be output as either degrees (true) or points of the compass (8 or 16). If degrees are output, then values are rounded to the nearest 
10 degrees and directions ending in 5 are rounded up (e.g. 105 degrees rounds to 110 degrees). When the wind speed is zero the wind direction is also zero 
(i.e. calm conditions).

The Bureau's wind measurements are designed to satisfy weather and climate monitoring needs.

The Bureau's current uncertainty tolerances for automatic wind speed measurements are +/- 5% of the wind speed for wind speeds greater than or equal to 10 m/s and 
+/- 0.3 m/s for wind speeds below 10 m/s.

As equipment is modernised at observing stations, the Bureau's continuous improvement requirement is to ensure that no change in equipment or algorithm 
results in wind speed measurements with a higher uncertainty, and where possible decreases uncertainty.

In 2010, with the incorporation of new monitoring equipment with improved algorithms to convert raw outputs into wind speed, a step change downwards in the 
wind speed measurements has occurred of the order of 0.5 m/s at some stations. Investigations have not lead to any evidence that the wind speed measurements 
using the Telvent Automatic Weather Station are outside the Bureau's uncertainty tolerance. We are confident that the new measurements provide a better estimate 
of the true wind speed, and may ultimately result in revised and improved uncertainty tolerances for Bureau wind speed measurements of both the past and future. 
We are now investigating ways to apply this knowledge to the past wind record.

PRESSURE

Station level pressure is the pressure measured at the weather station.

Mean sea level pressure (MSLP) is the station level pressure converted to an equivalent pressure 
at mean sea level. The use of MSLP allows for comparison of stations at different elevations. 
The MSLP is calculated by applying a coefficient to the station level pressure. The Bureau uses a 
table of coefficients that is localised to each weather station and for each month of the year. 
The coefficients are created by considering the height and surface temperature and humidity 
climatology at each weather station.

QNH pressure is obtained by taking the station level pressure and reducing it to mean sea level by 
assuming the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions between the station and sea level. 
QNH pressure is used by pilots to set the altimeter of their aircraft. QNH pressure is closely related 
to MSLP at low elevations but can vary significantly from MSLP at high elevations.

Most Automatic Weather Stations report observations of pressure as instantaneous values (1-second samples). 
A small proportion of our Automatic Weather Stations report a 1-minute average for pressure. The difference, 
if any, between these reporting periods is insignificant. 




AWS (AUTOMATIC WEATHER STATION) FLAG

0 Manned
1 Automatic
2 Hybrid

Indicates whether the observations are completely automatic or whether an observer is present, or a hybrid. 
In a couple of situations some differences occur due to the observation method. For example, Automatic Weather Station 
algorithms have had some difficulties in responding quickly to significant wind changes. Depending on the direction 
change the AWS may take several minutes to register the change and output a special weather report.




GENERAL NOTES
-------------




TIME

UTC - Coordinated Universal Time (sometimes called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).

Local Standard Time - The globe is divided into Standard time zones and Local Standard Time is the time specified for each zone.
This is usually done in terms of hours ahead or behind UTC.

Local Time - the time according to the local clock. Normally this is the same as Local Standard Time, but during Daylight Saving in 
eastern states an hour is added to the local clock, making Local Time an hour ahead of Local Standard Time.

When Daylight Saving begins the clock moves forward an hour at 2:00 am to 3:00 am. When this happens half hourly observations will 
occur at 01:00, 01:30, 03:00, 03:30.

When Daylight Saving ends the clock moves back an hour at 3:00 am to 2:00 am. When this happens half hourly observations will occur at 
02:00, 02:30, 02:00, 02:30, 03:00.

Care needs to be taken if analysing data against Local Time due to Daylight Saving, as a 9 am observation during Daylight Saving is 
really an 8 am observation in Local Standard Time. For elements such as temperature the difference can be significant, as the temperature 
at this time of day is often rising quickly.

Daylight Saving has been used in many Australian states since 1973, and on limited occasions prior to this. The changeovers generally 
occur in October and March, but exact dates vary from State to State and year to year. More information can be found at:
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml

Please note that some Antarctic stations adhere to Daylight Savings and others do not. They also do not always adhere to the 
Local Standard Time applicable to their longitude.




QUALITY FLAG DESCRIPTIONS

Y: quality controlled and acceptable
N: not quality controlled
W: quality controlled and considered wrong
S: quality controlled and considered suspect
I: quality controlled and inconsistent with other known information




LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES

Latitudes and longitudes are given to 4 decimal places, but in many cases will not be accurate to 4 decimal places. This is because in the early days 
the positions of stations were estimated from maps. Gradually the network of open stations is being checked (and if necessary corrected) using 
GPS (Global Positioning System). The method used is given in the station details file.




WMO INDEX NUMBER

This is the number assigned to a station that makes international weather reports. The number is not actively used in the climate archive, and only a 
few hundred such numbers are assigned at any time. These are not perpetual but may be reassigned where a station no longer makes the international 
reports (synops); thus a particular number cannot be regarded as unique and exclusive to any particular station.




PERCENTAGE COMPLETENESS INFORMATION

In some cases the percentage completeness will be overestimated. This will occur if the database has incomplete information about the element being 
selected. In cases where several elements are selected, rows with a least one of the elements available are considered complete. Where only a limited 
amount of data is available and the percentage completeness is less than 0.5%, an "*" has been used.

An "*" is also used if the percentage of values with a particular quality flag is non-zero and less than 0.5%.




GAPS AND MISSING DATA

Very few stations have a complete unbroken record of climate information. A station may have been closed, 
reopened, upgraded to a full weather station or downgraded to a rainfall only station during its existence 
causing breaks in the record for some or all elements. Some gaps may be for one element due to a damaged 
instrument or infrastructure outages and others may be for all elements due to the absence or illness of 
an observer.




INSTRUMENTS AND OBSERVATIONAL PRACTICES

Historically a nearby station (within about 1 to 2 km) may have used the same station number. There may have 
been changes in instrumentation and/or observing practices over the period included in a dataset, which may 
have an effect on the long-term record.
In recent years many stations have had observers replaced by Automatic Weather Stations, either completely 
or at certain times of the day.
